This is the implementation of Machine Learning algorithms in R

I am following the tutorial to understand how to use R to explore the dataset and implement some models that include basic machine learning algorithms.

The dataset is freely available, its a medium sized data set, not a toy or not a big dataset aswell.

I am very thankful to the Kaggle community especially camnugent !
